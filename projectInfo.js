            LargeDescription: 'The feeling of presence in virtual reality has enabled a large number of applications. These applications typically deal with 360° content. However, a large amount of existing content is available in terms of images and videos i.e 2D content. Unfortunately, these do not react to the viewer position or motion when viewed through a VR Head Mount Device.<br><br>Thus in this work, we propose reactive displays for VR which instigate a feeling of discovery while exploring 2D content. We create this by taking into account user position and motion to compute homography based mappings that adapt the 2D content and re-project it onto the display. This allows the viewer to obtain a more richer experience of interacting with 2D content similar to the effect of viewing through the window at a scene. We also provide a VR interface that uses a constrained set of reactive displays to easily browse through 360° content.<br><br>The proposed interface tackles the problem of nausea caused by existing interfaces like photospheres by providing a natural room-like intermediate interface before changing 360° content. We perform user studies to evaluate both of our interfaces. The results show that the proposed reactive display interfaces are indeed beneficial.',

            LargeDescription: "Designed and tested various prototypes of different genres of games like Tower Defense, Match-3, First and Third Person Shooter, Education, Fashion, Strategy and many more.<br>Some of the sample projects I would like to define:<br><br>• Anthropocene-The Game: Real-time strategy game for Android, built on Unity3D to spread message of climatic change and saving the environment. Gameplay: Maintaining balance between renewable and nonrenewable resources and not let in-game temperature rise by 2 degree Celsius <br><br>• Match-3: Built a match-three mini-game during internship period at Mech Mocha Game Std. Pvt. Lim., where player swaps two gems to make a pattern. Game had various combo moves like: 4-match: vertical or horizonal gem crusher, L shape-match: Bomb, 5-match: similar gem distroyer. <br><br>• Tower and Creeps: A tower defense game where player defends Home Tower by placing small towers to hit the Creeps and prevent them to reach the base. <br><br>• Escher Effect: Mimicked an illusion in virtual space. This illusion was also used in game- Monument Valley (by- Us Two).<br><br>• BodyShape: Educational grid game, where player completes a body by using tiles which can only be obtained if the number of turns already took is equal to the space between two tiles.",
